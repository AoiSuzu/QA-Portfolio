# QA-Portfolio
## About me
I’m a result-oriented person with an academic foundation in Philology and course training in software testing, who’s eager to make a significant contribution to ensuring high-quality software products. I’m ready to bring a blend of dedication, precision, and proactive approach to any project. I think, a good QA engineer knows how to write and explain clearly. So I believe that my previous experience in writing, reviewing documentation, and extracting important information gives me a good start for excelling in the QA field. I've completed the QA courses from [EPAM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gaCGk2FFnu52R_M051K09R_XVgNxKlqN/view?usp=drive_link) and QAtestlab and gained a solid foundation in both testing theory and practice.
